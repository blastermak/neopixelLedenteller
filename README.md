# neopixelLedenteller
Arduino code for operating the ledenteller in the 2017 EL CID-week

The idea of this project is to create a nice visual of the registered members during the introduction week of our student society.

Project consists of three Adafruit Neopixel strips configured to look like a seven segment display
When pushing a big red button the count will go up displaying that a new member has registered.
